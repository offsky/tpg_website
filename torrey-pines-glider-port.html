<p>The soaring site at the Torrey Pines Gliderport is an excellent site for slope soaring. Our club has a variety of events here throughout the year, but it is always open for general slope soaring fun. The site is owned by the City of San Diego and leased to the concessionaire <a href="https://www.flytorrey.com">Air California Adventure</a> for motorless flight operations.</p>

<p>Flying at Torrey Pines is fun and exciting! It provides some unique thrills and pleasures – reliable summer lift, sweeping vistas of some of the best coastline in the West, and the opportunity to fly with some very accomplished pilots – to name just three!</p>
<h2>Torrey Pines Gliderport Regulations</h2>
<p>The Torrey Pines Gulls always welcomes new or visiting pilots to come and fly at the Torrey Pines Gliderport. Some of the requirements for flying at Torrey Pines are modified for beginner pilots or those visiting for a short time, and these accommodations are described elsewhere on the website. For residents of Southern California who are non-beginners, here are the requirements for flying at Torrey Pines:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMA membership.  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.torreypinesgulls.org/membership.html">Membership</a> with the Torrey Pines Gulls or the <a href="https://www.tpsss.org">Torrey Pines Scale Soaring Society</a>.  </li>
<li>Everyone must obey the <a href="https://www.flytorrey.com/site-rules/">Flight Regulations</a>.  </li>
<li>The concessionaire requires all pilots to view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WysIW-dE6BA">Orientation Safety Video</a>, sign the current year’s waiver, and be video recorded reading a prescribed statement.  </li>
<li>You must pay the concessionaire either a one-day or annual use fee.  </li>
<li>Must pass the Pilot Certification (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Torrey Pines Gliderport is a complex operations area. Understanding and obeying the Gliderport Site Rules and the AMA Safety Rules is of the utmost importance for the safety of all pilots and spectators. The City of San Diego only allows motorless flight at the Gliderport. Electric or fuel powered aircraft of any kind are not permitted. If you have a powered glider, you must either remove or disable the propeller (or ducted fan) or tape/rubber band to secure a folding propeller.</p>
<h3>Pilot Certification / Rating</h3>
<p>You must have a Torrey Pines Gliderport rating before you can fly your RC glider solo. If you do not yet have a rating, once you meet all the other requirements, you may fly under the direct supervision of a rated pilot until you gain your rating. To become rated, contact the TPG Slope Coordinator to schedule a Pilot Rating flight at the Gliderport. The objective of the Pilot Rating flight is to ensure the RC glider pilot understands the Site Rules, demonstrates confident, safe control of his glider from launch to landing and <strong>can anticipate and give significant clearance to air traffic and pedestrians</strong>, at all times and in crowded situations.</p>
<p>For a skilled pilot with many hours of flying at other sites, obtaining a Pilot Rating may take no more than several minutes. For a novice pilot, or someone not experienced in flying a sea-cliff with multiple types of air traffic, obtaining a Pilot Rating could take a bit longer, but the process is not designed to be arduous, and is conducted in a friendly, win-win manner, with safety and enjoyment of the sport for all at its foundation.</p>
<p>The first step is to check out the plane to see that it is airworthy, the controls go in the right direction, and the linkages are good. We ask if the batteries have been in recent use and are freshly charged, and then conduct a range-check. We may hand-toss the glider in the landing area, or we may just launch it at the cliff, either with the owner flying it, or the check pilot flying it if the pilot is unsure for the very first time.</p>
<p>We expect the RC pilot to be constantly checking their own glider’s path, but also, for other RC gliders, slow-flying paragliders, and fast-flying hang-gliders. Constant adherence to the “blue sky rule” is a must and will greatly reduce the possibility of a collision between your glider and other aircraft. We also look for a competent landing pattern and landing. </p>
<p>We typically ask for two flights and landings, and in some cases ask for two different check pilots to provide certification sign-off, each overseeing a separate flight. If you are a good pilot, you can be certified in minutes; if you need to gain experience in this somewhat unique environment, you can do that as well. Once you receive a Pilot Rating, you are then cleared to fly on your own, and perhaps even help others through this pretty straightforward process.</p>
<p>After certification, you will be issued a rating that will be imprinted on the next issue of your TPG membership card. If you, as a rated pilot, have a temporary sponsored member join you at the Gliderport they can also fly. They must first meet the four concessionaire requirements listed above and can then fly under your direct supervision after you have briefed them on the local flight rules. Please note that the TPG member must spot for the guest and cannot fly at the same time.</p>
<h3>Flying at Torrey Pines can be Challenging</h3>
<p>Torrey Pines also presents some significant challenges: </p>
<ul>
<li>Strange and unexpected lift patterns and turbulence along the cliff, which vary dramatically with wind direction.  </li>
<li>Flying in the same airspace as full-size, manned gliders  </li>
<li>Flying with sometimes numerous Hang-gliders and Paragliders of varying skills and abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>A set of Flight Regulations have been arrived at to permit safe flying of all these modes while sharing the same air and ground space, and a good student can assimilate the meaning of some of these regulations quite quickly. But experience of flying in this mixed-mode environment is also essential to everyone’s safety and enjoyment, and that is why the RC pilots had to develop the Pilot Rating program. <strong>Think Safety!</strong> The objective of the Pilot Certification is to verify that the pilot has control over the glider, can perform some basic maneuvers and <strong>can anticipate and give significant clearance to other air traffic</strong>, sometimes in crowded situations.</p>
<p>The Torrey Pines Gliderport is approved as an FAA-Recognized Identification Area (FRIA) with the following dimensions pictured below. RC gliders within the FRIA do not need to be equipped with remote ID.</p>
